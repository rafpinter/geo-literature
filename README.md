# Geo Literature

This website aims to share the data about a survey of works written by women that contemplate female characters in homoaffective relationships. The publications are contemporary and made by French-speaking writers.


## Infrastructure

The webpage was created only using the Plotly Dash framework. It is encapsulated into a Docker container that ultimately is used by a Heroku App.
